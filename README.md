# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT--FDIA
Design of stealth algorithms to corrupt the safe operation of the the power system. This is my Final year project at The University of Lagos. This research examines the vulnerability of the power system to a data integrity attack. I modeled the whole system using MATLAB. This research forms a basis for the development of suitable countermeasures against such vulnerabilities
